<h1>Getting Started</h1>

This guide will help you make your first Showcase application and will teach you everything that you most likely will need to know.
The guide will be updated as Showcase is.

<h2>Linkers and Frames</h2>
Linkers and frames are used by Showcase to reference the devices and components needed to render as well as their parameters.

Linkers, specifically, reference a canvas element to use and render to.
Frames, specifically, provide the width and height components to resize the linked canvas to.
Frames, don't work without a linker, because the frame resizes a linked canvas.
